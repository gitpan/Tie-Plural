Tie::Plural, version 0.01
=========================

This module provides a simple and convenient way to format strings
with plural or singular inflections of various words or phrases,
using a tied hash to embed the choices within the strings.

This is a small, special-purpose module.  For a more general, powerful
set of functions for pluralizing words, see Damian Conway's excellent
Lingua::EN::Inflect module.

EXAMPLES

for $num (0..3)
{
    print "I have $num dog$pl{$num}.\n";
}

The above prints:
    I have 0 dogs.
    I have 1 dog.
    I have 2 dogs.
    I have 3 dogs.

$num = 700;
print "My wife owns $pl{$num,'many','one','no'} dress$pl{$num,'es'}.";

The above prints
    My wife owns many dresses.

DEVELOPMENT STATE

This is an early version of this module, so who knows what bugs lurk.

If you find any bugs, or if any behavior of Tie::Plural surprises you,
I would be grateful if you could send me an email message about it.
Thanks.
